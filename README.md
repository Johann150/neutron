**Neutron is not being developed any more. Please use some of the other whiteboard software available, for example [OpenBoard](https://openboard.ch/).**

A whiteboard drawing software that is focused on simplicity. Designed with our own teachers in mind that had and have difficulties switching to digital whiteboards.
