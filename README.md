Neutron as an electron desktop application

This is an electron port of [Johann150/scholar/tafel](https://github.com/Johann150/scholar/tree/master/tafel)

small tip: If you put a file named `template.nbrd` in the current working directory of the application<sup>1</sup>, it will automatically be opened on startup. But it's path won't be set for saving anything to later.

<sup>1</sup> If you don't know what the *current working directory* is, then it is probably the directory in which the program is stored.
