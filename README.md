A whiteboard drawing software that is focused on simplicity. Designed with our own teachers in mind that had and have difficulties switching to digital whiteboards.

This is an electron port of [Johann150/scholar/tafel](https://github.com/Johann150/scholar/tree/master/tafel)

small tip: If you put a file named `template.nbrd` in the current working directory of the application, it will automatically be opened on startup. But it's path won't be set for saving anything to later.
If you don't know what the *current working directory* is, then it is probably the directory in which the program is stored.
